    "# Preprocessing csv files with exported responses from Indico-based surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "- To reform indico-based survey response file structures so that they have the column headers and types of answer alternatives consistent with the pre-processed csv files based on surveys on Typeform for analyzing all the post-workshop survey data.\n",
    "- To keep data regarding new questions as well to analyze workshop specific data.\n",
    "- To make a basis for revising the analysis script `survey_analysis.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "1. Analyze and compare relevant files regardindg the followings:\n",
    "    - Column headers and which column each header is located, and\n",
    "    - Answer alternatives shown in the exported questions of each survey in JSON format\n",
    "2. For each response file exported from Indico, \n",
    "    - decide which column to be;\n",
    "        - deleted,\n",
    "        - renamed, and/or\n",
    "        - moved, and\n",
    "    - decide how to convert selected answer alternatives to column-data entry combinations\n",
    "   by keeping the format of the \"workshop-followup-survey-2018_processed.csv\" as much as possible\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation of inconsistency \n",
    "`exported_responses/readme.md` describes the differences in the survey questions and answer alternatives between relevant surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy for pre-processing of each response file\n",
    "#### Common for all files\n",
    "First of all, do the following 2 deletions before going to the further steps.\n",
    "- Delete the following columns:\n",
    "    - Submitter\n",
    "    - Submitter Email\n",
    "    - Submission Date\n",
    "- Delete the section names (from the first char to the first \":\") from each column header.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the followings assume that the section names are already deleted from each colum header.\n",
    "- Make a new column \"Other\" after \"What is your current position?\" (or modify the 2017 and 2018 files and set \"Other\" in the column \"What is your current position?\" for rows that have a value in \"Other\" column)\n",
    "- Make the following new columns: \"Reusable\", \"Reproducible\", \"Modular\", and \"Documented\". \n",
    "- Convert the answers to \"Would you judge your code to be better reusable/reproducible/modular/documented as a result of attending the workshop?\" to \"1\" or \"0\" for the columns made in the previous step. \n",
    "- Convert the \"yes\"/\"no\" answers to the following questions to \"1\"/\"0\" respectively:\n",
    "    - Has it become easier for you to collaborate on software development with your colleagues and collaborators?\n",
    "    - Have you introduced one or more of your colleagues to new tools or practices as a result of the workshop?\n",
    "- Keep the free-text answers in another file and delete these columns. The relevant column headers are the followings.\n",
    "    - What else has changed in how you write code for your research after attending a CodeRefinery workshop?\n",
    "    - Do you have any recommendations on how we should change the CodeRefinery curriculum?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### event_109_survey_24.csv\n",
    "- Move the column \"Would you recommend your colleagues to attend a CodeRefinery workshop?\" to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### event_194_survey_48.csv\n",
    "- Move the column \"Would you recommend your colleagues to attend a CodeRefinery workshop?\" to the end.\n",
    "- Move the column \"Participation style\" to the end.\n"

    "## Discussion\n",
    "### Items to be discussed: Questions and responses about the workshop's impact on use of introduced tools\n",
    "Indico-based surveys changed the way to let respondents to answer questions regarding the impact of the workshop on participants' practice in research software engineering from Typeform-based ones, i.e. letting respondents choose multiple options that are applicable to a series of questions, rather than asking about the workshop's impact on the use of a particular tool by choosing one. This caused many overlaps, and thus sometimes **contradictive responses are observed**. For example, the first 7 responses (rows) in event_39_survey_5.csv selected \"Version control (e.g. Git)\" for all the following questions;\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Post-workshop survey: Which tools/services have you started using as a result of attending the workshop?\"\n",

To run one analysis on all the pre-processed survey response datasets, we need change in the files from Typeform-based surveys in 2017 and 2018.
