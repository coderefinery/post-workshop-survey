The workshop also helped me get started using it in my daily work process. Even though I currently don't use all tools that the workshop covered I think I now, after attending the workshop, have an easier time getting starting with for instance automated testing.     Overall a very nice workshop that I have recommended colleges to attend!","I think it would be very interesting to have a workshop that focused more on one particular language, for instance how to write fast code in python. It would also be of interest to have a more lengthy discussion on how to structure and organize the code base.  Another thing that I found to be challenging can be to simply set up a useful ""system"" to name various files and folders, such that it is possible to keep track of the results for one project over time."
